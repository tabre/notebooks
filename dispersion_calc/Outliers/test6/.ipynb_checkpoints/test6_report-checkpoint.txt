REPORT DESCRIPTION
==================
N          -     Number of observations in population
µ          -     Mean of population
σ          -     Standard deviation of population
MDp        -     Mean deviation of population
ns         -     Sample size setpoint: integer or range (for random test-to-test sample size)
n          -     Mean sample size

METHOD     -     Method of calculating sample dispersion
MEAN       -     Mean of test-to-test sample dispersion
%ERR       -     Percentage of population dispersion represented by mean test-to-test sample dispersion difference from corresponding population parameter
                 Calculated as: (|S-σ|/σ)*100 and (|MDs-MDp|/MDp)*100
BEST       -     Number of tests ran where sample dispersion was closest to corresponding population parameter
%BEST      -     Percentage of tests ran where sample dispersion was closest to corresponding population parameter
